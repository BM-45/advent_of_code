# Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges in Python.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles throughout December. Each day presents a two-part challenge that tests problem-solving skills, algorithms, and coding abilities.

## Repository Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ day1.py          # Day 1 solution
â”œâ”€â”€ day2.py          # Day 2 solution
â”œâ”€â”€ day3.py          # Day 3 solution
...
â””â”€â”€ day14.py         # Day 14 solution
```

Each file contains:
- Part 1 and Part 2 solutions
- Input data processing
- Helper functions
- Comments explaining the approach

## Language & Tools

- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Clean, readable code with explanatory comments

## Running the Solutions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Execution

Run any day's solution:
```bash
python day1.py
python day2.py
# etc.
```

Or run with your own input:
```bash
python day1.py < input.txt
```

## Solutions Overview

| Day | Challenge | Status | Topics |
|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Day 1 | âœ… | Data processing, loops |
| 2 | Day 2 | âœ… | String parsing, conditionals |
| 3 | Day 3 | âœ… | Grid traversal, algorithms |
| 4 | Day 4 | âœ… | Pattern matching, validation |
| 5 | Day 5 | âœ… | Sorting, data structures |
| 6 | Day 6 | âœ… | Sets, counting |
| 7 | Day 7 | âœ… | Trees, recursion |
| 8 | Day 8 | âœ… | Simulation, state machines |
| 9 | Day 9 | âœ… | Sequences, extrapolation |
| 10 | Day 10 | âœ… | Graph algorithms, pathfinding |
| 11 | Day 11 | âœ… | Cellular automata |
| 12 | Day 12 | âœ… | Dynamic programming |
| 13 | Day 13 | âœ… | Pattern recognition |
| 14 | Day 14 | âœ… | Optimization, cycles |

## Approach

Each solution follows a consistent pattern:
1. **Input parsing** - Read and process the puzzle input
2. **Algorithm implementation** - Solve the problem efficiently
3. **Output** - Display the answer clearly
4. **Optimization** - Refine for better performance where needed

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, queues, stacks
- **Algorithms**: BFS/DFS, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms
- **Problem-Solving**: Pattern recognition, mathematical insights
- **Python Features**: List comprehensions, generators, functional programming

## Performance Considerations

- Solutions prioritize clarity while maintaining reasonable efficiency
- Most solutions run in under 1 second
- Optimizations documented where complexity is significant

## Learning Notes

Each challenge provided opportunities to practice:
- Algorithm design and implementation
- Edge case handling
- Code optimization techniques
- Problem decomposition strategies

## Future Plans

- [ ] Complete remaining days
- [ ] Add unit tests for each solution
- [ ] Document time/space complexity
- [ ] Create visualization for selected puzzles
- [ ] Refactor for improved readability
